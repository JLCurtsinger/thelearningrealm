For all designs I ask you to make, ensure they are beautiful, engaging, and unique, avoiding cookie-cutter layouts. Prioritize user experience, accessibility, and performance, ensuring the designs are fully featured and worthy of production use.

Webpages should be interactive and visually appealing, incorporating high-quality UI and UX principles. Use JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install third-party UI themes or icon packs unless absolutely necessary or explicitly requested.

All educational games and simulations should be intuitive, fun, and interactive, aligning with Lesson Link’s educational goals. Prioritize real-time feedback, progress tracking, and accessibility in learning activities. Avoid static, uninspired interfaces—everything should feel dynamic and engaging.

Use stock images from Unsplash where necessary, only linking to valid URLs. For icons and logos, use Lucide React. All custom-generated images should be high contrast, clean, and visually striking, in line with Lesson Link’s design philosophy.

Avoid bloated dependencies and keep the codebase clean and efficient. Ensure fast loading times and minimal external requests to optimize performance.
